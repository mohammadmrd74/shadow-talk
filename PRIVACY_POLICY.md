# Privacy Policy — Shadow Talk

**Last updated:** February 27, 2026

## Overview

Shadow Talk is a browser extension that helps users practice speaking by shadowing YouTube videos. This privacy policy explains what data the extension accesses and how it is handled.

## Data Collection

**Shadow Talk does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.**

## What the Extension Accesses

The extension accesses the following data, all of which stays entirely on your device:

### YouTube Page Content
- The extension reads caption/transcript data from YouTube video pages to display sentences for shadowing practice.
- This data is read directly from the YouTube page you are viewing and is not sent anywhere.

### Speech Recognition
- The extension uses the Web Speech API built into your browser (Chrome) to recognize your speech during practice sessions.
- Speech audio is processed by your browser's built-in speech recognition engine.
- The extension itself does not record, store, or transmit any audio.
- Note: Chrome's Web Speech API may send audio to Google's servers for processing. This is a browser-level behavior controlled by Google, not by this extension. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

### Local Storage
- The extension uses Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save user preferences such as selected language.
- This data never leaves your device.

## Permissions Explained
