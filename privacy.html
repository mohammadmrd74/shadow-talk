  <h1>Privacy Policy — Shadow Talk</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 27, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Shadow Talk is a browser extension that helps users practice speaking by shadowing YouTube videos. This privacy policy explains what data the extension accesses and how it is handled.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>Shadow Talk does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong></p>

  <h2>What the Extension Accesses</h2>
  <p>The extension accesses the following data, all of which stays entirely on your device:</p>

  <h3>YouTube Page Content</h3>
  <p>The extension reads caption/transcript data from YouTube video pages to display sentences for shadowing practice. This data is read directly from the YouTube page you are viewing and is not sent anywhere.</p>

  <h3>Speech Recognition</h3>
  <p>The extension uses the Web Speech API built into your browser (Chrome) to recognize your speech during practice sessions. Speech audio is processed by your browser's built-in speech recognition engine. The extension itself does not record, store, or transmit any audio.</p>
  <p><em>Note: Chrome's Web Speech API may send audio to Google's servers for processing. This is a browser-level behavior controlled by Google, not by this extension. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</em></p>

  <h3>Local Storage</h3>
  <p>The extension uses Chrome's local storage to save user preferences such as selected language. This data never leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
